# Shutterfly-Auto-Downloader
Bulk Download files from Shutterfly

Load the album you want to download in your browser and make sure you've selected All Images.
Go to your browsers "View Page Source" and copy the HTML source to an file called album.txt in the 
directory where you want to save the images, and run the program. You should see images starting to
appear in the directory.

This project was a quick and dirty way for me to download ~2000 photos off of shutterfly for a slideshow.
If you want to take it and adapt it to your purpose, feel free. However, I can't guarantee support, but
I'll try and answer questions if anyone sees this project and has any.
